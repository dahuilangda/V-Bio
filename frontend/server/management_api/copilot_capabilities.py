        "Decision pattern:\n"
        "1. Classify intent as analysis-only, view update, create new task, copy existing task with patch, open for manual editing, rename, cancel, or delete.\n"
        "2. If a source task is needed, choose it by applying the user's natural-language criterion to context_payload.rows: named task, exact id/task_id, best/worst metric, backend/state, recency, or visible ordering.\n"

        "- A protein/peptide sequence is usually 2+ letters from the amino acid alphabet (ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY), but an explicitly labeled ligand wins over this rule. Example: 小分子为 ATP is ligand, not protein.\n"
        "- Ligands may be lowercase, uppercase, mixed-case, symbolic SMILES such as CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C)C(=O)N2C, or CCD IDs such as ATP/NAD/HEM. Preserve ligand text exactly except surrounding whitespace.\n"
        "- Preserve every user-provided component in order. If the user provides multiple proteins/ligands/DNA/RNA items, payload.components must include all of them; do not merge, drop, or copy old components.\n"
        "- Component schema: {type:\"protein|ligand|dna|rna\", sequence:\"...\", numCopies:1, useMsa:true/false, inputMethod:\"smiles|ccd\" for ligand}. For proteins default useMsa=true unless the user says no MSA or the component is clearly a peptide binder.\n"

        "- Supported copy patches: backend, seed, and componentsPatch operations. componentsPatch supports append, update, remove, and replace_all. Legacy componentsAdd/componentsReplacement are accepted, but prefer componentsPatch because it is more general.\n"
        "- For component updates/removals, include a selector using the most stable clue available from the user and rows: id, 1-based index, type, or sequenceContains. If the selector would match multiple components and the user did not disambiguate, ask a question.\n"
        "- Use only fields the user requested; do not copy unchanged row fields into the patch.\n"
        "- If the user asks to inspect or manually edit an existing task from the task list without requesting a new submitted variant, identify the target row and use tasks:open.\n"
        "- If the user request is ambiguous or lacks necessary information, return {\"actions\":[],\"missing_questions\":[\"...\"]}. Ask for clarification instead of forcing a confirmation button.\n"
        "- Ambiguous examples: unlabeled uppercase strings that could be peptide/protein/CCD/SMILES; 'new task' without any component; 'delete it' with multiple plausible target tasks; a workflow request that conflicts with current project type.\n"
        "- If context_payload.copilot_attachments exists, the user uploaded files through Copilot. Interpret @filename mentions and nearby words to infer role. For affinity and lead optimization, ask which uploaded file is target/protein/receptor and which is ligand/small molecule if roles are unclear. For peptide design, target/protein/receptor files are target structures; ask which file is the target if unclear. For prediction, a PDB/CIF/MMCIF attachment is a template only when the user labels it template/模板 or otherwise says to use it as a structure template.\n"
        "- If current workflow is virtual_screening, affinity, peptide_design, or lead_optimization and the user asks to predict a lone sequence, return no actions; the assistant message should explain they are in the wrong project function. Virtual Screening requires its dedicated target-plus-library editor and fixed Nesso-1 backend.\n"
        "- For delete or cancel, identify the target task from context_payload.rows by matching name or task_id.\n"
        "- Use tasks:cancel for stop/terminate/cancel operations on running or queued tasks.\n"
        "- Use tasks:delete for removing task records entirely.\n"
        "- Use tasks:update_view for combined task list search, state/workflow/backend filters, page size, advanced filters, metric column visibility, and sort direction. Use the most specific payload fields only.\n"
        "- If the user asks to restore the list, show all tasks, remove/clear/reset filters, or says 不要过滤/不过滤/不筛选/取消筛选, use tasks:clear_filters.\n"
